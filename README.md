## Technologies Used

This project is built using the following technologies:

## Testing

Testing will be conducted both **manually and automatically** to ensure functionality and reliability.

### Backend Testing
For backend testing, we will use:
- **APITestCase** – To create test cases for Django REST framework.
- **APIClient** – To simulate API requests and validate responses.
- **PyTest** – To perform unit and integration testing.

### Frontend Testing
For frontend testing, we will use:
- **XCTest** – To set up automated UI and functional tests for the frontend at any stage.

All test cases will be documented and run regularly to maintain software quality.
